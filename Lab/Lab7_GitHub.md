### Lab 7: intro to GitHub

We will be following the tutorial here: https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. This tutorial is very good, and there is no sense in recreating the wheel. Instead, we will just be asking for a few screenshots along the way. 

One major note here, do all of this through Ron instead of your computer. This also means you do not have to install git--it is already installed there.

##### Students please note if you are accessing this and there are no questions yet, this means that we have not populated them. Please do not do the lab before there are questions. This is a short-term placeholder.
