### Transcriptome assembly

Today we will be doing a *de novo* transcriptome assembly. Similar to last week, we are going to compare a couple of different metrics!

Background information: You suddenly found yourself as a newt (you got better), and you want to assemble your transcriptome! This seems like a totally fine thing to do, and there isn't any sort of ethical issues with assembling your own genomic data. 

Usually, you will get quite a bit of sequence data in order to do any transcriptomic type project (often hundreds of millions of reads). For the purposes of this lab, I've downloaded data from this paper by Glass et al. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/653238v1.abstract) and randomly subsampled down to a dataset that we can work with for the confines of our lab time. To do this I used the `seqtk sample` command.
